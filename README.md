# SAKSHA - Crime Intelligence & Analytical Platform for Karnataka State Police

## Problem Statement

The Karnataka State Police (KSP) maintains extensive crime records containing information about incidents, offenders, victims, locations, and investigative details. However, the current analytical ecosystem faces several challenges:

* **Data Silos & Manual Processes:** Crime records are often stored across independent systems and Excel-based reports, making integrated analysis difficult.
* **Lack of Advanced Analytics:** Existing systems focus on reporting rather than intelligence generation, leaving hidden patterns and criminal networks undiscovered.
* **Information Gaps:** Fragmented information limits the State Crime Records Bureau's ability to perform comprehensive state-wide crime analysis.
* **Reactive Policing:** Current workflows primarily respond to incidents after they occur, with limited support for proactive policing and preventive strategies.

As crime data continues to grow in volume and complexity, there is a need for an intelligent platform capable of transforming raw records into actionable insights for investigators, analysts, and policymakers.

# Proposed Solution

## Saksha: An Intelligent Crime Intelligence & Analytics Platform

Saksha is an AI-powered Crime Intelligence and Analytical Platform designed to transform traditional crime records into a comprehensive intelligence ecosystem. The platform combines geospatial analytics, criminological network analysis, machine learning, and conversational AI to help law enforcement agencies move from reactive reporting to proactive crime prevention.

The system acts as a centralized intelligence hub that enables investigators to uncover hidden relationships, identify emerging crime patterns, predict high-risk areas, and make data-driven operational decisions.

---

# Solution Objectives

The platform aims to:

* Integrate fragmented crime datasets into a unified analytical environment.
* Discover hidden relationships between offenders, victims, locations, and criminal activities.
* Identify spatial and temporal crime hotspots.
* Detect organized crime structures through network analysis.
* Forecast emerging crime risks using AI and machine learning.
* Provide natural language access to crime intelligence.
* Support evidence-based policing and strategic decision-making.

## 6. Anomaly Detection Engine

The anomaly detection module identifies incidents that deviate from established behavioral patterns.

### Features

* Unusual crime pattern detection
* Suspicious activity alerts
* Rare event identification
* Behavioral outlier analysis

### AI Techniques

* Z-score L2 deviation scoring (custom NumPy, with train/evaluate/predict interface)
* Statistical outlier detection over temporal, spatial, and categorical features
* Rule-based fallbacks when no trained model artifact is present

Note: earlier revisions of this document mentioned Isolation Forest / Local
Outlier Factor; the shipped implementation is the Z-score L2 deviation model in
`backend/app/ai/models/anomaly/model.py`.

### Outcomes

* Discovery of hidden threats
* Early detection of emerging criminal activities
* Support for complex investigations

* Demographic information

### Features

* Crime vs Population Analysis
* Crime vs Urbanization Analysis
* Socio-economic correlation studies
* Root cause intelligence reports

### Outcomes

* Evidence-based policymaking
* Better resource planning
* Long-term crime prevention strategies

---

## 8. Conversational AI Crime Analyst

A natural language interface allows investigators to interact with crime data using simple questions.

### Example Queries

* Show burglary hotspots in Bengaluru.
* Find repeat offenders linked to vehicle theft.
* Identify districts with increasing cybercrime cases.
* Predict high-risk areas for the next month.
* Show criminal associations linked to suspect X.

### Technologies
