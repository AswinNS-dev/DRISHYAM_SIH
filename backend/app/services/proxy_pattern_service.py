"""
Proxy Pattern Detection Rules Engine (issue #225, PROXY-001..PROXY-020).

The identity-resolution engine (``identity_service``) answers "are these two
records the same person?". This engine answers a deliberately narrower,
investigative question: *"is there an explainable pattern consistent with one
person acting as a proxy for another?"*

Design rules:
  * Rules are *conservative and explainable* — every output carries a rule id,
    version, confidence, supporting + counter evidence and a short list of
    possible innocent explanations (family phone, reassigned number, data-entry
    error). Nothing is ever an automatic accusation.
  * Severity is driven by the *strength and independence* of the pattern, never
    by the identity of the individuals involved.
  * Suppression / grouping collapses repeated observations of the same pattern
    into a single alert.
  * Rules run over the same normalized, PII-light entity profiles as the
    identity engine so results stay consistent and testable.
