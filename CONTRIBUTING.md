# Development Workflow

All development must follow the GitHub Issue workflow.

```
Issue

↓

Create Feature Branch

↓

Implement Feature

↓

Run Tests

↓

Commit Changes

↓

Push Branch

↓

Create Pull Request

↓

Code Review

↓

Merge
```

Never commit directly to the `main` branch.

# Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names.

Examples

```
feature/fir-management

feature/hotspot-model

feature/network-analysis

feature/ai-chat

fix/login-validation

fix/dashboard-api

docs/readme-update

refactor/auth-service
```

# Before You Start

Before working on any task:

- Read the project README.
- Read `agent_rules.md`.
- Read the assigned GitHub Issue carefully.
- Understand the project architecture.
- Pull the latest changes from the repository.

---

# Development Rules

Contributors must:

- Work only on the assigned GitHub Issue.
- Keep changes focused.
- Preserve existing functionality.
- Follow the existing project architecture.
- Maintain backward compatibility.
- Write clean and maintainable code.

Do NOT:

- Modify unrelated modules.
- Rewrite working functionality.
- Introduce unnecessary dependencies.
- Commit generated files unless required.
- Rename files or folders without approval.

# AI-Assisted Development

AI-assisted development is supported.

If using tools such as:

- ChatGPT
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Claude
- Gemini
- Windsurf
- Codex

You must:

- Follow `agent_rules.md`.
- Review all generated code.
- Test all generated code.
- Remove unnecessary AI-generated changes.
- Ensure generated code follows project standards.

The contributor remains fully responsible for all submitted code.

# Coding Standards

Backend

- Follow FastAPI best practices.
- Use type hints.
- Keep routes lightweight.
- Place business logic inside services.
- Use Pydantic schemas.
- Reuse existing utilities.

Frontend

- Use reusable React components.
- Keep components modular.
- Maintain existing UI patterns.
- Use TypeScript properly.
- Avoid duplicated logic.

Database

- Never modify schema without approval.
- Never commit credentials.
- Use migrations when applicable.

AI/ML

- Keep models independent.
- Reuse shared preprocessing.
- Follow the common model interface.
- Register trained models through the MLOps pipeline.

# Testing

Before submitting a Pull Request, verify:

Backend

```
pytest
```

Frontend

```
npm run build
```

Development

```
npm run dev:all
```

Ensure:

- No runtime errors.
- No build failures.
- No TypeScript errors.
- No React warnings.
- No broken API integrations.

---

# Pull Requests

Every Pull Request should:

- Solve a single issue.
- Have a clear title.
- Include a meaningful description.
- Pass all CI checks.
- Be reviewed before merging.

# Thank You

Thank you for contributing to Saksha.

Your contributions help build a modern AI-powered Crime Intelligence Platform for smarter policing and public safety.

## Local CI parity

Run the same checks locally that GitHub Actions runs on your PR:

```bash
# Frontend (datathon/)
cd datathon
npm ci
npm run lint          # ESLint - zero warnings allowed
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm test              # Vitest unit/component tests
npm run build         # production build

# Backend (backend/)
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m compileall app tests -q
ruff check .          # config in ruff.toml
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///:memory:" JWT_SECRET_KEY="ci-test-secret" APP_DEBUG=false pytest tests -q

# Repo-wide
python scripts/check_secrets.py       # secret scan
python scripts/check_spa_routing.py   # after npm run build
```

CI (`ci.yml`) fails if any of these fail, and includes a merge-compatibility job that dry-run merges your branch into `main` to catch conflicts before GitHub does.
